hashcompare
===========

Compare random files in two directory trees using md5

The intended use case is comparing copies of large directories which contain a
very large number of files, where one-to-one comparison would take too long.
This script can be used as a preliminary or a "good enough" check to see if
there is a mismatch in any of the randomly selected files.
